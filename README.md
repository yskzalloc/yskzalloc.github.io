## Configuration

Your portfolio should reflect your unique style and achievements. Here’s how you
can customize it:

- Most of the displayed content can be found in the `routes` directory,
  specifically in `_app.tsx` and `index.tsx`.
- To update your work experience, skills, or any other information, head to the
  relevant sections in `index.tsx`.
- Information about your social links, credentials and metadata can be
  configured inside of `_app.tsx`.

> Dont forget to replace the sample CV with your own under `static/cv.pdf`.

#### Example

the `Experience` function under `routes/index.tsx`. The page section should
generate automatically.

```ts
interface Experience {
  title: string;
  company: string;
  timePeriod: string;
  location: string;
}

function Experience() {
  const experiences: Experience[] = [
    {
      title: "System Software Developer",
      company: "Ericsson",
      timePeriod: "07/2023 - Present",
      location: "Seoul, South Korea",
    },
